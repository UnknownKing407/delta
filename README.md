This app allows accessing advanced hotspot settings not exposed through the
system settings app on devices that use Stock Android (Pixel, Nothing, etc.)

It provides various information and features such as:
- Usual info provided by settings app such as hotspot name, passphrase, security
type, frequency bands, quick connect using QR, etc.
- List of connected devices.
- Modifying amount of devices that can connect.
- Changing MAC randomization settings.
- Setting auto turn-off timeout.
- Blocklist to prevent certain devices from connecting.
- Make hotspot's SSID hidden (device doesn't appear on WiFi scans)
- Quick setting tile to easily turn hotspot on/off from notification shade.
- Control hotspot using Tasker/other automation apps.

It uses Shizuku to obtain hotspot related details and to modify hotspot
settings. It is also useful on devices like Samsung Tabs (WiFi-only) where
hotspot settings are hidden from Settings app and SystemUI.

Signing-off on commits is enforced on GitHub but not on Crowdin and thus, I
