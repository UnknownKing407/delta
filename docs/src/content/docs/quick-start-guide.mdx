Here is a step-by-step guide for you to get started if you are using apps like
this for the first time.

## Enable Developer Options

First, you need to enable Developer Options on your Android device.

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **About phone**.
2. Tap on **Build number** seven times until you see a message that says,
   "You are now a developer!".
3. You may need to enter your device's PIN or password to complete this step.
</Steps>

## Install Shizuku

Download and install Shizuku app from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api)
or from the [official website](https://shizuku.rikka.app/download/).

## Setting up Shizuku

Refer to this [setup guide](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/) on
Shizuku's website.

<Aside>
For non-rooted devices, you will need to restart the Shizuku service every
time you reboot your device.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
- Do not disable Developer Options after setting up Shizuku, as this will cause it
to stop working.
- You can turn off Wireless Debugging after Shizuku has started, but **do not**
turn off USB Debugging. Shizuku needs at least one of them to be enabled to
keep running in the background. The `adbd` process, which Shizuku relies on,
will be terminated if both are disabled.
</Aside>

## Install Delta

Now that Shizuku is set up, you can install Delta.

Grab the latest release of Delta either from [GitHub](https://github.com/supershadoe/delta/releases/latest)
directly, using [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) or from the
[IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/dev.shadoe.delta) F-Droid repo.

## Using Delta

Once Delta is installed, open the app. It will request permission to access Shizuku.
Grant it, and you're ready to start using the app!
